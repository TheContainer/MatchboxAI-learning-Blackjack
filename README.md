MatchboxAI is learning Blackjack.

If you run the AI without a file in the same folder with the name 
"training_saves.py", the AI will create a file with that name.

As the name suggests, the AI will store every learning progress in that file.
The progress file I provided here has a bit of learning progress if you dont want to train it yourself,
but just play against the AI.

The console will also print out the learning progress before and after the
game to see, what changed.
